# MySQL-Hospital
Data Analysis and Manipulation using MySQL Workbench and online database

In this project, I executed a number of questions for an online database which included hospital data. 

I also added a screenshot of the database schema so that both relations among the tables and data types per table will be known. 

For my analysis, I used MySQL Workbench. 

The database, the data and the questions to be answered based on the data, are taken from the following site:
